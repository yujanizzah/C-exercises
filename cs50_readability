/*
    SPECIFICATIONS:

    Design and implement a program, readability, that computes the Coleman-Liau index of the text.

    Implement your program in a file called readability.c.
    Your program must prompt the user for a string of text (using get_string).
    Your program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
    Your program should print as output "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.
    If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output "Grade 16+" instead of giving the exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output "Before Grade 1".

    NOTE: This readability version does not include intelligent sentence detection (abbreviations such as Mr. or Mrs. may count as a sentence due to period) nor caters to typing mistakes and so, proper grammar and punctuation is recommended.
